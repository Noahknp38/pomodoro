<h1>What is Pomodoro?</h1>

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. <br>
It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "Pomodoris". 


<h1>How it works</h1>

1. Choose a task you want to work on.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro).
3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. Take a short break (usually around 5 minutes).
5. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (usually around 15â€“30 minutes).


<h1>Problems</h1>
